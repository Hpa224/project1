Project #1 - Wish Local

Welcome to our application - Wish Local! Our app helps users find local stores that contain the items they desire as quickly and locally as possible. It then plots the stores on a map so they can determine which is closest.

Our motivation for creating this map was that we felt there was a need for an application that finds local stores. Many a time we have run out of time to buy a gift online. We've also gone to a store that we believed would have an item for which we were searching only to realize they don't vend that product. We hope this app will solve those two issues by finding local items quickly and from the right vendors.

We utilize several different free resources for this app. Our real-time database is hosted on Firebase. We have two different libraries that we use: Materialize for CSS and JQuery for the ability to use AJAX along with Javascript. Our app pulls information from two free APIs: Yelp to retrieve information on which stores contain the items we seek & MapQuest to plot the stores on a map.

There is no current need or functionality to install this application. This project is hosted by GitHub Pages and available on the net.

Using this application is as simple as clicking the "Get Started" button. A modal will appear with the option to enter some search parameters. Upon submitting your refinements, a list of your stores will populate a table and you'll be able to view a map with the store's locations.

Shoutout and many thanks to everyone who contributed to Project #1. The development team consisted of Patrick, Liena, Ramon, & Stephen. The development was loosely split us as follows; the Back-end team: Ramon & Patrick and the Front-end team: Liena & Stephen.

Thank you for using viewing and using our application.
